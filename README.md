The Approach:
In this project, I leveraged my experience in fintech to predict customer churn, applying multiple machine learning models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. 

Here's how I approached it:

Data Collection:
I worked with a real-world customer churn dataset to get a realistic view of the problem.
Data Preprocessing:
Missing Values: I replaced missing values with zero in a key column, ensuring no gaps in the data.
Categorical to Numerical: Used Label Encoding to convert categorical variables (like customer segments and product types) into numerical features for model compatibility.
Cross-Validation:
Performed cross-validation to assess how each model performs across multiple data folds, ensuring that my results were not skewed by a single train-test split.
Modeling:
I applied Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost to predict which customers are likely to churn.
XGBoost outperformed the other models, showing superior predictive accuracy and efficiency, which is critical in a fast-paced fintech environment.
Evaluation:
After training the models, I evaluated them using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring the model I deployed would deliver real business value by correctly identifying at-risk customers
